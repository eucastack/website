&lt;p>This topics describes the relationship of the components in a Eucalyptus installation.
&lt;img src="https://www.eucastack.io/images/euca_arch_separate_hosts.png" alt="image">
The cloud components: Cloud Controller (CLC) and Walrus, as well as user components: User-Facing Services (UFS) and the Management Console, communicate with cluster components: the Cluster Controllers (CCs) and Storage Controllers (SCs). The CCs and SCs, in turn, communicate with the Node Controllers (NCs). The networks between machines hosting these components must be able to allow TCP connections between them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ceph provides an alternative to Walrus as an object storage provider, and can also be used as a block storage provider (EBS).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Plan Your Hardware</title><link>https://www.eucastack.io/docs/install_guide/eucalyptus/planning/services_placement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.eucastack.io/docs/install_guide/eucalyptus/planning/services_placement/</guid><description>
&lt;p>This topic describes ways you can install Eucalyptus services on your physical servers.You can run Eucalyptus services in any combination on the various physical servers in a data center. For example, you can install the Cloud Controller (CLC), Walrus, CC, and SC on one host machine, and NCs on one or more host machines. Or you can install each service on an independent physical server. This gives each service its own local resources to work with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Often in installation decisions, you must trade deployment simplicity for performance. For example, if you place all cloud (CLC) and zone (CC) services on a single machine, it makes for simple administration. This is because there is only one machine to monitor and control for the Eucalyptus control services. But, each service acts as an independent web service; so if they share a single machine, the reduced physical resources available to each service might become a performance bottleneck.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Plan Services Placement</title><link>https://www.eucastack.io/docs/install_guide/eucalyptus/planning/services_understanding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.eucastack.io/docs/install_guide/eucalyptus/planning/services_understanding/</guid><description>

&lt;h2 id="cloud-services">Cloud Services&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The main decision for cloud services is whether to install the Cloud Controller (CLC) and Walrus on the same server. If they are on the same server, they operate as separate web services within a single Java environment, and they use a fast path for inter-service communication. If they are not on the same server, they use SOAP and REST to work together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes the key factor for cloud services is not performance, but server cost and data center configuration. If you only have one server available for the cloud, then you have to install the services on the same server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All services should be in the same data center. They use aggressive time-outs to maintain system responsiveness so separating them over a long-latency, lossy network link will not work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="user-services">User Services&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The User Facing Services (UFS) handle all of the AWS APIs and provide an entry point for clients and users interacting with the Eucalyptus cloud. The UFS and the Management Console are often hosted on the same machine since both must be accessible from the public, client-facing network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may optionally choose to have redundant UFS and Management Console host machines behind a load balancer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="zone-services">Zone Services&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Eucalyptus services deployed in the zone level of a Eucalyptus deployment are the Cluster Controller (CC) and Storage Controller (SC).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can install all zone services on a single server, or you can distribute them on different servers. The choice of one or multiple servers is dictated by the demands of user workload in terms of number of instances (CC) and EBS volume access (SC).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things to consider for CC placement:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Place the CC on a server that has TCP/IP connectivity to the front-end servers and the NC servers in its zone.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Each CC can manage a maximum of 4000 instances.
Things to consider for SC placement:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The SC host machine must always have TCP/IP connectivity to the CLC and be able use multicast to the CLC.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The SC must have TCP/IP connectivity to the UFS/OSG hosts for uploading snapshots into the object store. (The SC does not require connectivity directly to users, it is an internal component and does not serve user EBS API requests; that job is done by the UFS.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The SC must be reachable via TCP/IP from all NCs in the zone within which the SC is registered. The SC and NC exchange tokens to authorize volume attachment, so they must be able to directly communicate. The SC provides the NCs with network access to the dynamic block volumes on the SC&amp;rsquo;s storage (if the SC is configured for overlay local filesystem or DAS-JBOD).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>IF using Ceph the SC must also have TCP/IP connectivity to the Ceph cluster.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If you are going to use overlay local filesystem or DAS-JBOD configurations to export local SC storage for EBS, then SC storage should consist of a fast, reliable disk pool (either local file-system or block-attached storage) so that the SC can create and maintain volumes for the NCs. The capacity of the disk pool should be sufficient to provide the NCs with enough space to accommodate all dynamic block volumes requests from end users.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="node-services">Node Services&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Node Controllers are the services that comprise the Eucalyptus backend. All NCs must have network connectivity to whatever machine(s) host their EBS volumes. Hosts are either a Ceph deployment or the SC.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Plan Disk Space</title><link>https://www.eucastack.io/docs/install_guide/eucalyptus/planning/space_verifying/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.eucastack.io/docs/install_guide/eucalyptus/planning/space_verifying/</guid><description>
&lt;p>We recommend that you choose a disk for the Walrus that is large enough to hold all objects and buckets you ever expect to have, including all images that will ever be registered to your system, plus any Amazon S3 application data. For heavy S3 usage, Riak CS is a better choice for object storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
&lt;h4 class="alert-heading">Note&lt;/h4>
We recommend that you use LVM (Logical Volume Manager). If you run out of disk space, LVM allows you to add disks and migrate the data.

&lt;h1 id="plan-networking-modes">Plan Networking Modes&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>These networking modes are designed to allow you to choose an appropriate level of security and flexibility for your cloud. The purpose is to direct Eucalyptus to use different network features to manage the virtual networks that connect VMs to each other and to clients external to Eucalyptus .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eucalyptus networking modes are generally modeled after AWS networking capabilities. In legacy AWS accounts, you have the ability to choose EC2 Classic network mode or VPC network mode. New AWS accounts do not have this flexibility and are forced into using VPC. Eucalyptus VPCMIDO mode is similar to AWS VPC in that it allows users to fully manage their cloud network, including the definition of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block, subnets, and security groups with rules for additional protocols beyond the default three (UDP, TCP, and ICMP) available in EC2 Classic networking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your choice of networking mode depends on the following considerations:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Does your cloud need to mimic behavior in your AWS account? If you need EC2-Classic behavior, select EDGE mode. If you need EC2-VPC behavior, select VPCMIDO mode.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do you need to create security group rules with additional protocols (e.g., all protocols, RDP, XTP, etc.)? If so, choose VPCMIDO mode.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If there is no specific requirement for either mode, then VPCMIDO mode is recommended given its flexibility and networking features.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Each networking mode is described in the following sections.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Prepare the Network</title><link>https://www.eucastack.io/docs/install_guide/eucalyptus/planning/preparing_network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.eucastack.io/docs/install_guide/eucalyptus/planning/preparing_network/</guid><description>
