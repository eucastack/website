We are excited to announce the Eucalyptus Cloud 4.4.3 release!

There are a couple of changes included that go beyond those in a typical 
maintenance release.

<!--more-->

The release uses a 2-Clause/Simplified BSD license, which replaces the GPL 
license used by previous releases. Euca2ools and the management console were 
already BSD licensed, so with this release the licensing is consistent across
the major components.

The RPM repository location has changed, updated Eucalyptus and Euca2ools 
release RPMs should be installed as detailed in the 
[install guide](https://docs.eucalyptus.cloud/eucalyptus/4.4.3/install-guide/installing_euca_release.html)
so that the new downloads.eucalyptus.cloud location is used.

You can find the full list of 
[resolved issues](https://docs.eucalyptus.cloud/eucalyptus/4.4.3/index.html#release-notes/4.4.3/4.4.3_rn_resolved.html) 
in the release notes.
